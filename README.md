C console Quiz app with questions from: sports, history, biology, literature and technology.


The Quiz has two main parts, the game and the administrative part.
The first one is divided into two parts: a multiple choice quiz and a short answer quiz, both with randomized questions. The two games are built to be played separately. In the case both of them are played under the same name, the best score and time (time spent while playing the game) will be taken into account for the ranking. At any time, the user may return, as the game allows returning users to score higher than the previous round. So, the score for that user will be modified. Moreover, the names are not allowed to be repeated, thus the ranking will not have two usernames the same. 
Furthermore, the maximum score that could be gathered by a user is 5 points (as there are 5 questions in each game). If the score is the same for two different users, the order will be indicated by the descending order of the points, and if the points are the same, the order will be told by the ascending order of the time. Basically, the person with the most points and the best time will be leading the standings.


The administrative part is for the administrator and develops other features. The usual user will not be able to connect to it because the admin mode is protected by a password. The admin may delete questions from the two games, may add questions (for both multiple choice and short answer quizzes) and may change the password for the access into "admin mode".
