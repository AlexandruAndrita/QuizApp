C console Quiz app.

The Quiz has two main parts, the game and the administrative part.
The game consists of two parts: a multiple choice quiz and a short answer quiz. The two games are built to be played separately. In the case both of them are played under the same name, the best score and time will be taken into account and introduced in ranking. At any time, the user may return, as the game allows returning users to score higher than the previous round. Moreover, the names are not allowed to be repeated, thus the ranking will not have two usernames the same. 

The administrative part is for the administrator and develops more features. The usual user will not be able to connect to it because the password will be unknown for the rest of the users. The admin may delete the questions from the two games, may add questions (for both multiple choice and short answer quiz) and may change the password for the access into "admin mode".
